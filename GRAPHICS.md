# Visualizing System Relationships


SSH-Snake's output can be used to create visualizations of the network it has traversed. For example, using the python script _generate-graph.py_ provided in [tools/](tools/), we can generate a PNG visualizing the network:

![A graph visualizing the relation between systems using SSH](tools/SSH-Snake-dot-circo.png)
In [this image](tools/SSH-Snake-dot-circo.png), the blue nodes indicate a destination that can connect to itself (meaning a key on the system is also trusted by `authorized_keys`). The red edges/lines indicate that the connection from one system to another is bi-directional, meaning system A can SSH to system B and system B can SSH to system A. Note that this image includes usernames in the system labels.

This graph was created using the command:

```bash
python3 tools/generate-graph.py --with-users --file SSHSnake.log --format dot
circo -Tpng -Goverlap=false -Gsplines=true -Gconcentrate=true -Gnodesep=0.1 -Goverlap=false SSHSnake_dot_file.dot -o SSH-Snake-dot-circo.png
```

which first generates a [dot file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language), then uses [graphviz' circo](https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/circo/) to generate a PNG.

An alternative visualization can be created in [gexf format](https://gexf.net/), and then [Gephi](https://gephi.org/users/download/) can be used to create another meaningful image:

In [this image](tools/SSH-Snake-Gephi.svg), the green nodes indicate a _host_ (without a username) that can connect to itself, and green lines/edges indicate that the connection is bi-directional. The gray host in the top right corner is the host that the script was initially executed on. Note that the hosts do __not__ include the usernames of the system, and this visualization indicates system to system connections, rather than destination (`user@host`) to destination (`user@host`) connections.

This graph was created using the command (note the lack of `--with-users`):

```bash
python3 tools/generate-graph.py --file SSHSnake.log --format gexf
```

Using Gephi, the final image was generated.

Cytoscape is another tool that can be used to generate interesting graphs. Using the same gexf format output file from before, you can install the gexf-app app for Cytoscape and import the file.
